The game is about trying to navigate through the college experience by having the player choose course loads and subjects of study.

In Step two, if/elif/else statements are displayed and put to use.
In Step three, membership and logical operators were used.
In Step four, all concepts including identity operators were used.

Playing the game is simple. You input your informationa and when option choices appear, choose the one you would like.

The different endings determine how your experience went. In the end it will determine if you will graduate with honors and leadership in STEM, with have a standard graduation, or if you will barely graduate.

During the creation, I used AI for help during step 3. Although I used it, it did not help me. I also used AI for an idea on what I should do in step 4. It gave me the idea to do the graduation and helped me with an issue with the is operator. I used copilot AI to help.
